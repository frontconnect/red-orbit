description: "What is Red Orbit?"

This is my first post. I feel pretty stressed at the moment. I feel like I am making a huge
commitment. I started it, and I have to keep it up! I have attempted to blog several times
my whole life. I managed to blog a couple of times, and that's it.

This time, I have a different feeling! I think I will continue writing. Because, this time
I'm not sticking to any rule, theme, concept. I'm just a curious person with diverse interests
and, I want to write about whatever I find interesting. This is how I discover the world.

They say changing hobbies and interests or getting easily bored is something bad. Well, I say
this is who I am.

Oh! What is Red Orbit, again? Means nothing :) I just think this is a cool name and 
why not use it? Here I am, writing this blog post about redorbit.io.
